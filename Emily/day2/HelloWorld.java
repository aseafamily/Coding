// A source file is something that we understand, and if I write this it isn't a source code. But if I put the two slashes in front of  this, it's a comment. We want computers to understand a source file, but they can't understand it. So we have to make them understand them. HelloWorld.java is something that we understand, but computers don't understand, so we change the source file into something that they can underestand. It's called HelloWorld.class. It's something that the computer understands. Now the comptuer can understand what you write. In summary, javac turns something that we understand into something that the computer understands. The c in javac means compile.You use javac to compile. And then when you want your computer to run it, you use java.
// THe class in the beginning, the class HelloWorld- everything in java is a class. HelloWorld is the name of this class. So we tell the computer, Computer, Do Something. The computer says, Ok I'll do it, but asks, Okay, how do I start. HOw can I get started. THe comupter looks for what to start, and in java, as long as you start with public static void main(String[] args), it will start. System.out.printIn, is the part that prints it out.
